<h4>Project Idea </h4>
<p>In future after my studies at RMIT University, I would like to work on projects like simulation. I am passionate about car modding. I would like to develop a simulator connected with a mobile app which will help people who are passionate about cars before purchasing a new car or while remodelling their old car. This simulator can be played as a video game and as well as a tool for vehicle manfuactors and mechanic and also for passionate drives.</p>

<p>I would like to use Unity as its platform-independent. It will help me to develop apps for both android and apple. It will also help me to develop for mac and windows as well. Unity is a cross-platform game engine
The reason I chose unity is that it can make both 2d and 3d. Which will help me to make my simulator more realistic and customer friendly. As well as it can be used while making the Android, Apple, windows and mac app.</p>

<p>In the simulator, the main functions will be Moding the. It will show the customer how they can change with visual instruction. the can choose from thousands of option. they will be able to change or modify or upgrade every single part of there cars such as the bumper, spoilers, headlights, the wheel rims, indicator light etc. They will also be able to change the interior or exterior colour of the car as well as the seat colours. People can also check the durability of the brake.</P>

<p>The app can also be very much helpful while giving information about the vehicle and also. It will tell the user how will be its performance on offroad and as well as on-road. The fuel efficiency of the car.The engine power of the car. The entertainment system. How much torque the engine can produce. The durability of the body. How will it work in different weather conditions like Driver's training in sunny weather is available. The trainee can choose driver's training in rainy weather. Wiper arms are available in the program and these operate integrated with the equipment. Driver's training in snowy weather is available. Driver's training in foggy weather is available. Also, the information about Artificial intelligence if any car has it or available installation. The app can also suggest a particular type of driving or usage of the vehicle. The passenger capacity or the capacity of caring weigh. </P>

<p>The simulator will be more focused towards the new drivers and that will help them to gain more knowledge about cars. They can choose from thousands of car. They can learn about each and every feature of the car. They can also do a virtual test drive of their favourite car and can try out the durability and engine performance of the car. They will also be able to drive with different weathers. They will also be able to try out different modification and get a visual experience and knowledge about the changes in performance while driving the car. all of the progress and data can also be accessed from the phone app or the through computer programs linked to the simulator.</p>

<p>The main tools and technology that is required for this project is unity.rather than unity a manufacturer will be necessary as the simulator needs to be built. Both hardware and software expertise will be necessary and needs to work as a team.</p>

<p>The outcome of this project will be making a good relationship between the mechanical industry and the IT industry. It will solve a lot of confusion and also will increase the confidence of many drivers as they will be able to see what they are actually buying. And the profit can be earned from both the Automotive manufacturer and also from the customers.</p>
